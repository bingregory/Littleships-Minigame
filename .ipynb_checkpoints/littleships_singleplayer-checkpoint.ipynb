    "Overview:  a single-player game written in python3. The player has 15 shots to sink 5 littleships in a 5x5 grid.\n",
    "The player shoots one shot at a time until the boats are sunk or he runs out of shots.\n",
    "\n",
    "Method: The game is scripted to be easily adjustable. Only three variables need to be set - pond size, number of shots allowed and number of littleships. Features include randomly generated littleships, a shot tracker to prevent duplicate shots, and a validator to ensure shots are within bounds.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Potential features to add:\n",
    "1. Larger littleships: this will require additional logic to ensure subsequent coordinates are (1) consecutive, (2) randomly horizontal or vertical, and (3) within bounds following the first random coordinate.\n",
    "2. 2-Player version: this will require (1) a second shot_tracker function that alternates with the first, and (2) a starting sequence for each player where they choose their ship locations. \n",
    "3. A visual display of shots fired: this will require generating an array with Xs and Os after each shot. "
